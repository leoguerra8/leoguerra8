### "Hello there" ðŸ‘‹ "General Kenobi..."

ðŸ‘¯ I'm Leonardo, but everybody calls me Leo.

ðŸ”­ I got my M.Sc. Computer Science and Engineering degree @ [PoliMi](https://www.polimi.it/), where I got my bachelor's degree (Laurea Triennale in Ingegneria Informatica), as well.
My master thesis was part of a larger project, aiming to help autistic persons to be more autonomous in daily life use case scenarios, using Mixed Reality and Conversational Agents. In particular, I focused on the [subway use case scenario, with Augmented Reality and Conversational Agents](https://github.com/leoguerra8/5AAR-Subway).
